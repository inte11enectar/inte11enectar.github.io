Hi there! I'm Mohtasim Hafiz

## Who I Am

Originally from Bangladesh, I’m a freshman at Georgetown University in Qatar, studying International Affairs.

It’s always tricky to answer “where are you from” — I spent my early years in Bangladesh before moving to the UAE, where I lived for nearly 15 years. In 2019, I returned to my roots, and half a decade later, I find myself back in the Gulf, continuing my journey in a region that feels both familiar and new.

## My Journey

Shaped by my parents’ hopes and societal expectations, I pursued the hard sciences throughout high school. Yet, my true curiosity always leaned toward the world of ideas — (geo)politics, economics, religion, and philosophy. In college, I’m grateful to finally explore these passions in depth. Suffice it to say, my future aspirations continue to grow from these very interests.


## My Interests (very broad, for now)

- Politics
- Economics (game theory and its real world applications)
- Speculative Theology (Ilm al-Kalam)
- Religion and Reformist Movements
- Philosophy (Classical and Islamic)

## Fun Facts

- For a very brief period, I wanted to study CS (God saved me)
- I represented my country in an Int'l Olympiad and won a bronze medal
- I can identify 50+ rocks and minerals
- I can type 160+ words per minute! 
- I know how to flip butterfly knives 
- I'm the only person to speak English in my family (and my village too!)
