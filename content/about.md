Hi there! I'm Mohtasim Hafiz

## //identity

Originally from Sylhet, Bangladesh, I’m a freshman at Georgetown University in Qatar, studying International Affairs.

It’s always tricky to answer “where are you from” — I spent my early years in Bangladesh before moving to the UAE, where I lived for nearly 15 years. In 2019, I returned to my roots, and half a decade later, I find myself back in the Gulf! It's an ambivalent feeling, I must say. 

## //journey

Parents’ hopes and societal expectations led me to pursue STEM throughout high school. Yet, my true curiosity always leaned toward the *fun* stuff — philosophy, (geo)politics, economics, religion and so on. I'd spend hours reading pop philosophy (shout-out to Julian Baggini) to distract my mind from cringy organic chemistry. In college, I’m grateful to finally explore these passions in depth. Suffice it to say, my future aspirations continue to grow from these very interests.


## //interests (very broad, for now)    

- Politics
- Economics (game theory)
- Speculative Theology (Ilm al-Kalam)
- Religion and Reformist Movements
- Philosophy (Classical and Islamic)
