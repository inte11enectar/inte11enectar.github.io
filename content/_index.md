Hello, I’m **Mohtasim Hafiz**, a freshman at **Georgetown University in Qatar**, where I’m studying **International Affairs**.

I’m broadly interested in the intersections of politics, philosophy, theology, and economics — and how ideas shape societies and governance.

This website serves as a space to share my writings ongoing intellectual explorations.

You can reach me at [mh2446(at)georgetown(dot)edu](mailto:mh2446@georgetown.edu) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohtasim-hafiz-775ba32a4/).
