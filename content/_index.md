Hello, I’m **Mohtasim Hafiz**, a freshman at **Georgetown University in Qatar**, where I’m studying **International Affairs**.

I’m broadly interested in the intersections of politics, philosophy, theology, and economics — and how ideas shape societies and governance. More about me [here](https://mohtasimhafiz.com/about/).

This website serves as a space to share my writings and ongoing intellectual explorations. You can read my blog posts [here]({{< relref "blog" >}}) and academic work [here]({{< relref "publications" >}}) (hopefully it won't be empty for too long!).

You can reach me at [mh2446(at)georgetown(dot)edu](mailto:mh2446@georgetown.edu) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohtasim-hafiz-775ba32a4/).
