For the longest time, I've been planning to create my very own personal website. In hopes of being productive over this fall break, I finally decided to load up VScode and start writing code.

Last time I picked up the big 3 (HTML, CSS and JS) was back when I wanted to study CS (which was a while ago). But given SSG's inherent markdown structure and my ongoing obsession with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (which is notoriously known for its .md functionality), it didn't take much time to get things sorted. Given my interest in (semi)technical social science research, henceforth, I'll digress from WD altogether and entirely devote my attention to R and Python. 

This website will, however, continue to be under development as I tweak things here and there. My life was certainly made easier by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a Go-based SSG. Although I used [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/) as the base theme, I substantially customized it to suit *my* minimalist aesthetic. 

On to the land of intendations!
