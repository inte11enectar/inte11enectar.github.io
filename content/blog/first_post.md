For the longest time, I've been planning to create my very own personal website. In hopes of being productive over this fall break, I finally decided to load up VScode and start writing code.

Last time I picked up the big 3 (HTML, CSS and JS) was back when I wanted to study CS (which was a while ago). But given SSG's inherent markdown structure and my ongoing obsession with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (which is notoriously known for its .md functionality) it didn't take much time to get things sorted. Given my interest in semi-technical social science research, from now onward, I'll digress from WD altogether and entirely devote my attention to R and Python. 

This website will, however, continue to be under evelopment as I tweak nuts and bits here and there. My life was certainly made easier by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator. Although I used [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/) as the base theme, I substantially customized it to suit *my* minimalistic aesthetics. Either way, here's the link to the [github rep](https://github.com/inte11enectar/inte11enectar.github.io/tree/main) for anyone interested. 

On to the land of intendations!
