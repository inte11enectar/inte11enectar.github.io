I\u0026rsquo;m Mohtasim Hafiz\nWho I Am Originally from Bangladesh, I’m a freshman at Georgetown University in Qatar, studying International Affairs.\nIt’s always tricky to answer “where are you from” — I spent my early years in Bangladesh before moving to the UAE, where I lived for nearly 15 years. In 2019, I returned to my roots, and half a decade later, I find myself back in the Gulf, continuing my journey in a region that feels both familiar and new.\nMy Journey Shaped by my parents’ hopes and societal expectations, I pursued the hard sciences throughout high school. Yet, my true curiosity always leaned toward the world of ideas — (geo)politics, economics, religion, and philosophy. In college, I’m grateful to finally explore these passions in depth. Suffice it to say, my future aspirations continue to grow from these very interests.\nMy Interests (very broad, for now) Politics Economics (game theory and its real world applications) Speculative Theology (Ilm al-Kalam) Religion and Reformist Movements Philosophy (Classical and Islamic) Fun Facts For a very brief period, I wanted to study CS (God saved me) I represented my country in an Int\u0026rsquo;l Olympiad and won a bronze medal I can identify 50+ rocks and minerals I can type 160+ words per minute! I know how to flip butterfly knives I\u0026rsquo;m the only person to speak English in my family (and my village too!)
